To redeem a code, players typically need to follow these steps:  
1. Open the Brawl Stars app on their device.  
2. Navigate to the in-game shop or a dedicated redemption section.  
3. Enter the code in the provided text box and confirm the submission.  

It's important to note that these codes are usually time-sensitive and may have region-specific restrictions. Additionally, only official codes shared by Supercell through their social media channels, official website, or community events are legitimate.  

Players should avoid third-party websites claiming to provide "free unlimited codes," as they are often scams or could compromise account security. Staying updated on Supercell's announcements is the best way to ensure access to valid and timely Brawl Stars redeem codes.
